TumblGallery
============
Version 1.3.0
(4/20/2013 )

- Added category filtering
- General code revisions.

Description:

This is a basic image gallery custom page for use with Tumblr. Provided a blog name and corresponding API key, it will automatically generate pages of image thumbnails based on a 3 x 6 grid. Forward and backward buttons allow pagination through the grids. A category dropdown dynamically filters the images based on a tag list provided in the "blogInfo" object.

When clicked, a Twitter Bootstrap based modal will appear with a larger version of the image, a corresponding caption, and any associated tags. Back and previous arrows allow you to navigate between images directly within the modal window.

Requirements:

- Tumblr blog account
- API Key
